Licensee shall not disclose any Confidential Information to any third party.

For clarity and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Licensee shall not disseminate any Highly Confidential Beta Software to Licensee's sales and marketing field organizations.  Licensee will assign an employee who will be primarily responsible (.Primary Contact.) for ensuring that the terms of this Agreement are complied with.  
(ii)  Improper Disclosure of Highly Confidential Beta Software.  Licensee acknowledges that damages for improper disclosure of Highly Confidential Beta Software or related information concerning product features, future technologies and roadmaps may be irreparable and that monetary damages would be inadequate to compensate VMware for any breach of this Agreement.  In the event that VMware reasonably believes that Licensee has disseminated certain of such Highly Confidential Beta Software or related information concerning product features, future technologies and roadmaps to an unauthorized party, Licensee will be immediately removed from VMware.s Beta Software program and will not be permitted to participate in any VMware Beta Software program in the future.  Additionally, all rights and licenses granted to Licensee under this Agreement shall immediately terminate in accordance with Section 3 herein (Term and Termination), and (b) in addition to all other remedies available in law or otherwise, VMware is entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and preliminary injunction against the threatened breach of this Agreement or  the continuation of any such breach.
